Spring Social Twitter 1.1.0 Milestone 3 (? ?, 2013)
===================================================
Miscellaneous
  * Upgraded to Jackson 2

Spring Social Twitter 1.1.0 Milestone 2 (February 12, 2013)
===================================================
Miscellaneous
  * Changes to support Spring Social/Spring Security integration.
     (SOCIAL-232)

Bug Fixes
  * Set character set to UTF-8 for string parts of multipart messages to allow for
    Korean and other characters to be posted in status updates. (SOCIALTW-37)

Improvements
   * Added ability to perform advanced searches, including searches that
     specify the language of the Tweet. (SOCIALTW-41)
   * Added favorited field to Tweet object. (SOCIALTW-43)
   * Added ticker symbol pseudo-entity to Tweet's Entities object. (SOCIALTW-44)

Spring Social Twitter 1.1.0 Milestone 1 (November 26, 2012)
==================================================
Compatibility Notes:
   * Due to changes in Twitter's API between v1.0 and v1.1, Spring Social
     Twitter's API binding was required to change to match. Consequently,
     some methods and data available in Spring Social Twitter 1.0.x's API 
     binding may be different or completely missing in v1.1.0. In those
     cases, deprecation did not make sense in this case, since Twitter's 
     API will no longer offer equivalent operations for backward 
     compatibility. The only choice was to rework the API bindings.

Improvements
   * Updated API binding to comply with version 1.1 of Twitter's API.
     (SOCIALTW-39)
   * Added XML configuration support for Twitter connection factory and API
     binding beans. (SOCIAL-292)
   * Added Java configuration support for Twitter connection factory and API
     binding beans. (SOCIAL-293)     
   * Added a retweeted property on Tweet to indicate whether the user has
     retweeted a status or not. (SOCIALTW-29)
   * Support for entity data in Tweet object. (SOCIALTW-33)

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.2 (January 23, 2012)
===============================================
Bug Fixes:
   * Throw RateLimitExceededException when a user exceeds their
     daily status update limit. (It was throwing
     OperationNotPermittedException.) SOCIALTW-27

Improvements:
   * Capture "retweet_count" property on a Tweet object. SOCIALTW_26

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.1 (December 15, 2011)
===============================================
Bug Fixes:
   * Fixed the date format for daily trends (SOCIALTW-14)
   * Check for a list of errors vs. a single string error when
     consuming errors from Twitter's REST API (SOCIALTW-17)
   * Fixed UserList.isPublic() to be bound to "mode" property in
     JSON response (SOCIALTW-18)
   * Exposed BlockOperations through Twitter interface
     (SOCIALTW-20)

Improvement:
   * Added UserOperations.getRateLimitStatus() to API binding
     to fetch the rate limit data. (SOCIALTW-16)
   * Added restOperations() to Twitter interface to enable
     consumption of Twitter endpoints that aren't yet covered
     by the API binding (SOCIALTW-13)
   * Removed unused userId parameter from ListOperations.
     getListSubscribers(). (SOCIALTW-19)
   * SearchOperations.createSavedSearch now returns the newly
     created SavedSearch object. (SOCIALTW-21)
   * DirectMessageOperations.sendDirectMessage() returns the
     sent DirectMessage object. (SOCIALTW-22)
   * Added getDirectMessage(id) method to DirectMessageOperations
     (SOCIALTW-23)

Compatibility Note:
   * Twitter deprecated the current trends endpoint, and now 
     returns and HTTP 410 if you attempt to use it. Therefore,
     SearchOperations.getCurrentTrends() has been removed from the
     API binding. (SOCIALTW-15)
   * ListOperations.getListSubscribers() previous accepted a
     userId parameter that was unused. That parameter has now been
     removed.

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.0 (September 8, 2011)
===============================================
Bug Fixes:
   * Added a byte array message converter to fix errors when fetching
     images from Twitter.

Misc:
   * Updated TwitterTemplate to match changes in AbstractOAuth1ApiBinding.

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.0.RC3 (August 25, 2011)
=================================================
Improvements:
   * Added support for Twitter's new media upload to enable photos
     to be uploaded with status updates. (SOCIALTW-6)
   * Changed signature of TimelineOperations.updateStatus() to return
     a Tweet object for the newly created status; previously it returned
     void. (SOCIALTW-8)
   * Added an inReplyToStatusId property to StatusDetails so that tweets
     may be posted that are in reply to an existing tweet.

Spring Social Twitter 1.0.0 RC1 (July 26, 2011)
===============================================
Improvements:
   * Support for paging and cursoring for operations that return
     paged or cursored data lists. (SOCIALTW-5 and SOCIALTW-4)

Compatibility Note:
   * DuplicateTwitterException has been removed in favor of the more
     general DuplicateStatusException added in Spring Social Core 1.0.0.RC2.
