===============================================
Bug Fixes:

   * Check for a list of errors vs. a single string error when

   * Fixed UserList.isPublic() to be bound to "mode" property in
     JSON response (SOCIALTW-18)

     (SOCIALTW-20)

Improvement:
   * Added UserOperations.getRateLimitStatus() to API binding
     to fetch the rate limit data. (SOCIALTW-16)
   * Added restOperations() to Twitter interface to enable
     consumption of Twitter endpoints that aren't yet covered
     by the API binding (SOCIALTW-13)
   * Removed unused userId parameter from ListOperations.
     getListSubscribers(). (SOCIALTW-19)
   * SearchOperations.createSavedSearch now returns the newly
     created SavedSearch object. (SOCIALTW-21)

     (SOCIALTW-23)

Compatibility Note:

     returns and HTTP 410 if you attempt to use it. Therefore,
     SearchOperations.getCurrentTrends() has been removed from the
     API binding. (SOCIALTW-15)
   * ListOperations.getListSubscribers() previous accepted a
     userId parameter that was unused. That parameter has now been
